     Biking is my main form of transportation, more so than the train, ubers and walking. <br>
     My bike is called Sounis, after a fictional country from the Queen's Thief series <br>
     and I've had it since 2019 <br>

        I've been playing soccer since middle school. In another life I would've loved <br>
        to play professionally, but until then I play on a couple leagues in the city. <br>
        I also don't know anything about Tottenham (the team that ball is from), I just liked the colors.
