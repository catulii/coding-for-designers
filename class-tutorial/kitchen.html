      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | a shoe rack with shoes on every possible surface | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

      I live with three roommates and the shoe rack by the kitchen entrance is evidence of this, <br>
       there's shoes of every type: heavy doc marten boots, sturdy black blundstones, summer strappy sandals <br>
       worn white sneakers that are falling apart at the soles, short heels and snow shoes.
       <p>
        | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | a fridge covered in pictures and notes | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
        | | |
      </p>
      <p>
        The fridge is almost like a gallery <br>
        it's covered in post-its noting a need for oatmilk, postcards <br>
         from various friends and ourselves, magnets from trips, invitiations to weddings.
