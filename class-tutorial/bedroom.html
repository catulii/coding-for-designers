      I started rock climbing in September of last year and I've become one of <br>
      those annoying peopole that really loves it and is constantly telling  <br>
      people "Omg come climbing it'll change your life" but that's because it  <br>
      actually is one of the things that keeps me sane

      I love playing video games, especially story-driven RPGS but  <br>
      I've recently started playing more rouge-likes and third-person shooters.  <br>
      I recently finished Resident Evil 4 and I'm replaying Red Dead Redemption.
